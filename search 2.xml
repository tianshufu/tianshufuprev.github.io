<p>This is because that I had deleted the  mysql connection jar file on the desketop before, so when the Intelij try to find it through the old path, it did not work out.</p>

    <title>My story in 2049</title>
    <url>/2020/02/01/My%20Big%20story%20in%202049%20%20resilient%20from%20frustration/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="My-Big-story-in-2049-resilient-from-frustration"><a href="#My-Big-story-in-2049-resilient-from-frustration" class="headerlink" title="My Big story in 2049:     resilient from frustration"></a>My Big story in 2049:     <strong>resilient from frustration</strong></h2><p>I had always been believing that frustration and jibes can be overwhelmed by continuously efforts. The last place of the running competition had always belonged to me when I was in primary school since I was so fat, and my classmates jibed that why a so fat guy would take part in the sports competition. Then I worked extremely hard to lose fat and keep training and got my first gold medal during my first year of high school. The girl I crushed on while I was in high school pointed me out that I was not good at study as she does and won’t have a good fortune if being together with me. Then I studied very hard and got the national price of math competition which she always been dreaming for. I cried in front of my head teacher in while in high school since he was mentioning a story that I never wanted to talk about, and he said that no girls would like such a weak guy like me. Then I started to become more strong both in body and mental and won a lot of favor.</p>
<p> After getting through these, I tend to believe that no matter how big the frustration is , as long as I worked hard enough, I could always beat it. However, one thing happened two years ago had totally changed my mind. My grandma had died in an accident of emergency, I didn’t even get the chance to see her last face. I felt terribly bad and I tried to think about ways of getting over it like I used to do and I found that it’s impossible since one of the most people I love in the world had gone and there is nothing I can do to get her back. Then my parents came to find me and three of us were sitting in a coffee bar, we knew the hard-wound in each of our hearts but we smiled to each other and talked about something fun in our daily life. I felt a lot better after that. As I can’t change the fact that my grandmother had gone, I could embrace the life I had right now. Then I knew that there is always something in the world that I can’t change no matter how hard I try, but united with the best person I love could give me a lot of strength to keep moving forward. There is always something I can’t beat up with, but by uniting with each other we can become more and stronger.</p>
<p>​There is something you can’t change no matter what, there is also something you can’t change by yourself. I had not realized there is so a big prejudice towards China until I had started my exchange semester in Berkeley. I tried to change the prejudice but I found it’s so hard. For example, I could clarify that Taiwan belongs to China to one person but during the next day someone else would ask me the same question. Most of the Chinese people in the US were trying to change that prejudice and try to prove that we are a strong and developed nation but we weren’t really united together.</p>
<p>​2049, the year when we are reaching our 100 years, the year I’m gonna be 50, hope I could be more united with the person whom I loved while facing setbacks, hope all the Chinese people could all united together when facing a big issue while staying abroad, hope China could become a developed country through the fast developing trend!</p>
